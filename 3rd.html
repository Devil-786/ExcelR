                        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven<br> players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end,<br> each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores<br> runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running<br> between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent<br> this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and<br> dismiss each batter (so they are "out").
